## General info
This project is a simple blog api that allows users to Signup, Login, Create, Edit and Delete a Post (while logged in) and Logout. You can access the database via the <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/personal-blog-frontend">frontend component </a> or through rails console - although that won't be a pretty to look at. 

In the future I'd like to add a comments section and like button.
